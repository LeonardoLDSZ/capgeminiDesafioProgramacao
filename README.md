# Capgemini Academy Programming Challenge


The purpose of this repository is to present the resolution of the questions below, proposed by the Capgemini Programming Challenge. For the resolution of such questions, the language JAVA and IDE IntelliJ was used.

To run the code, just give a git clone https://github.com/LeonardoLDSZ/capgeminiDesafioProgramacao.git

Questions follow:

Question 01 - Write an algorithm that shows on the screen a ladder of size n using the character * and spaces. The base and height of the ladder must be equal to the value of n. The last line must not contain any spaces.

Question 02 - DÃ©bora signed up on a social network to keep in touch with her friends. The registration page required filling in the name and password fields, but the password must be strong. The site considers a password strong when it meets the following criteria:

- It has at least 6 characters.
- Contains at least 1 digit.
- Contains at least 1 lowercase letter.
- Contains at least 1 capital letter.
- Contains at least 1 special character. The special characters are: !@#$%^&*()-+

Deborah has typed a random string into the password field, but she is not sure if it is a strong password. To help Deborah, build an algorithm that informs what is the minimum number of characters that must be added for any string to be considered safe.

Question 03 - Two words can be considered anagrams of themselves if the letters of one word can be reallocated to form the other word. Given any string, develop an algorithm that finds the number of pairs of substrings that are anagrams.
